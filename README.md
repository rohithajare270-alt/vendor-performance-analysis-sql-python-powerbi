## Overview
This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization.  
A complete data pipeline was built using **SQL for ETL**, **Python for analysis**, and **Power BI for visualization**.

## Business Problem
Retail companies often struggle to:
- Identify which vendors generate profits  
- Detect suppliers that lock capital through unsold inventory  
- Optimize supplier strategy based on performance  

This project aims to solve these challenges using data.

---

## Dataset
- Vendor-level sales and inventory data  
- Includes: sales price, profit, stock quantity, unsold inventory value  
- Cleaned and structured for analytics  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **SQL** – Joins, aggregations, KPI calculations  
- **Power BI** – KPI dashboards, vendor ranking, trend analysis

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and null values  
- Standardized numeric columns  
- Created KPIs such as Profit Margin & Inventory Turnover  
- Aggregated vendor-level performance metrics

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Revenue contribution by vendor  
- Profit margin distribution  
- Unsold inventory value analysis  
- Vendor risk segmentation  

---

## Key Insights
- A small group of vendors contributes most revenue  
- Several vendors lock high capital in unsold stock  
- Low-margin vendors reduce overall profitability  
- Optimizing vendor mix can significantly improve performance

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Vendor performance ranking  
- Sales & profit trends  
- Inventory risk analysis  
- KPI cards  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Re-negotiate or replace low-margin vendors  
- Reduce stock for slow-moving suppliers  
- Prioritize high-performing vendors  
- Implement performance-based supplier contracts
